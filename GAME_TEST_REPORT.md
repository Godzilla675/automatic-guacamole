## 🎮 Manual Desktop Gameplay Testing (Feb 13, 2026)

### 1. Game Launch & Menu Screen
- ✅ Loading screen shows correctly with spinner and "Loading game..." text
- ✅ Menu screen appears after ~1 second with title "🎮 Voxel World" and subtitle
- ✅ "Start Game" button works and transitions to game
- ✅ ~~**BUG #3: Controls button does nothing**~~ **FIXED** — Added click handler in `main.js` to toggle `#controls-info` visibility.

**Screenshot — Menu Screen:**
![Menu Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7382e513-3590-475f-849a-400a2ada05b3)
*Menu screen loads cleanly. Controls button visible but non-functional.*

**Screenshot — Controls button clicked (no effect):**
![Controls No Effect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc5db2d-6a42-4064-bb78-3ae3ace295ce)
*After clicking Controls, nothing happens — the controls info panel never appears.*

### 2. Game Initialization & World Rendering
- ✅ Player name prompt appears on game start
- ✅ World generates with terrain (snow biome at spawn, elevation ~24)
- ✅ Procedural 16×16 pixel-art block textures render correctly
- ✅ Blocks visible: snow, stone, ores, grass, dirt, trees
- ✅ Minimap renders in top-right corner
- ✅ FPS displays at 17–34 FPS range (Canvas 2D, no WebGL)
- ✅ Debug info shows position, block count, time correctly
- ✅ Day/Night cycle transitions work (observed "Day" → "Night" → "Day")
- ✅ Weather system works (observed "Weather changed to rain" and "Weather changed to snow")
- ⚠️ WebSocket connection error on startup (expected without dedicated server)

**Screenshot — Game World Initial View:**
![Game Initial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d069e51-b12f-406b-80d1-a49504703528)
*Game loads with terrain, HUD elements, and hotbar visible. Note death messages in chat.*

### 3. ~~CRITICAL BUG: Player Death Loop (Bug #1)~~ ✅ FIXED
- ✅ **Previously critical — now fixed**
- **Original Issue:** Player spawned at y=40, terrain surface at y≈24. Player fell 16+ blocks, died, respawned at y=40, fell again. Infinite death loop.
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Added `World.getSurfaceHeight(x, z)` method to find actual terrain surface
  - `game.js init()` now sets spawn to `getSurfaceHeight + 1` (right above ground)
  - `player.respawn()` recalculates safe height dynamically
  - Capped dt in game loop to prevent huge first-frame physics step after `prompt()` pause

**Screenshot — Death Loop Chat Flood:**
![Death Loop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fca9b31e-1fe4-4bae-9a82-2b587cc6a50b)
*Chat completely flooded with death messages. Health bar shows ~5% (1 HP remaining).*

**Screenshot — Continued Death Spam:**
![Death Spam](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29dff467-9954-46df-9312-56d17f664258)
*After several seconds, death messages continue to accumulate.*

### 4. HUD & UI Elements
- ✅ Health bar renders (but shows 5% due to death loop damage)
- ✅ Hunger bar renders at 100%
- ✅ XP bar renders at 0% with level "0"
- ✅ Crosshair (20×20px) centered on screen
- ✅ Hotbar shows 9 slots with number labels (1-9)
- ✅ Debug info panel: FPS, Position, Blocks count, Time
- ✅ Tutorial message "Welcome! Use W,A,S,D to move." appears at bottom
- ✅ Pause button (⏸️) visible in bottom-right

### 5. Pause Menu
- ✅ Pause button works, shows "Game Paused" overlay
- ✅ Options: Resume, Save World, Load World, Settings, Return to Menu
- ✅ Clean professional UI design
- ✅ Resume button returns to game

**Screenshot — Pause Menu:**
![Pause Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0467d2db-db47-45d4-b37a-23c744182225)
*Professional pause menu with all major options.*

### 6. Settings Menu
- ✅ Volume slider works (0-100 range, default 50)
- ✅ FOV slider works (30-110 range, default 60)
- ✅ Sensitivity slider works (0.1-5.0, default 1.0)
- ✅ Key bindings displayed for all actions (Forward/W, Backward/S, etc.)
- ✅ Reset Defaults button present
- ✅ ~~**BUG #6: Skin Color picker misplaced under "Audio" section**~~ **FIXED** — Moved to new "Appearance" section in `index.html`.
- ✅ ~~**BUG #4: Settings "Back" button resumes game instead of returning to Pause menu**~~ **FIXED** — Now re-shows `#pause-screen` when closing settings.
- ✅ ~~**BUG #7: Render Distance slider/value mismatch**~~ **FIXED** — Changed step from 16 to 2 so default 50 aligns correctly.

**Screenshot — Settings Screen:**
![Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0247df99-cf5e-45ae-b1d1-7626c890007d)
*Settings menu showing all three sections. Note Skin Color under Audio.*

### 7. Inventory Screen
- ✅ Opens with 'E' key
- ✅ Shows "Inventory" heading and "Close (E)" button
- ✅ ~~**BUG #2: Inventory renders empty with JavaScript error**~~ **FIXED** — Added `.block-icon` and `.slot-count` child elements to armor slots in `refreshArmorUI()`.
- **Root Cause:** `ui.js` `refreshArmorUI()` (line 1133) calls `renderSlotItem(slot, armor[i])` but armor slots don't have `.block-icon` or `.slot-count` children. `renderSlotItem()` (line 1273) does `slotElement.querySelector('.block-icon')` which returns null, then tries to access `.style` on null.
- **Impact:** Inventory appears completely empty — player cannot see or manage items.

**Screenshot — Empty Inventory:**
![Inventory Bug](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c4a03dc-a671-429e-b982-9d6ad3e31e17)
*Inventory screen opens but is empty. The JS error prevents all slot rendering.*

### 8. Crafting Screen
- ✅ Opens with 'C' key
- ✅ Shows available recipes based on player inventory
- ✅ "Close (C)" and "Recipe Book" buttons present
- ✅ ~~Pressing 'C' again does NOT close the crafting screen~~ **FIXED** — 'C' now toggles crafting open/closed.
- ✅ ~~**BUG #8: Duplicate recipe names**~~ **FIXED** — Renamed to "Stick from Birch (4)" and "Stick from Jungle (4)".

**Screenshot — Crafting Screen:**
![Crafting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/944e97c1-1fa4-47b1-9fb2-eeaa60679644)
*Crafting screen with duplicate "Stick (4)" entries visible.*

### 9. Game World Rendering
- ✅ 3D isometric projection renders correctly
- ✅ Block textures (procedural 16×16 pixel art) display properly
- ✅ Multiple biomes visible (snow biome at spawn)
- ✅ Trees generate with trunk and leaf blocks
- ✅ Ores visible underground (coal, iron visible in terrain)
- ✅ Water blocks render with transparency

**Screenshot — World Rendering:**
![World](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560b03ec-863a-4f7a-adae-6de544d1a45a)
*Game world with terrain, blocks, and procedural textures rendering correctly.*

## 📝 Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Immediate Fixes Required (Unblocks Gameplay)

1. **Fix Player Death Loop (Bug #1)**
   - Change `spawnPoint.y` in `player.js:43` to match actual terrain height
   - Add a `findSafeSpawnY()` function that scans downward from y=40 to find the first solid block
   - Set both initial `this.y` and `spawnPoint.y` to `terrainHeight + 2`

2. **Fix Inventory Rendering (Bug #2)**
   - In `refreshArmorUI()` at `ui.js:1113-1140`, add `.block-icon` and `.slot-count` child elements to armor slots before calling `renderSlotItem()`
   - Or add null checks in `renderSlotItem()` at line 1273: `if (!icon) return;`

3. **Fix Controls Button (Bug #3)**
   - Add event listener in `main.js` for `#show-controls` to toggle `#controls-info` visibility:
   ```js
   document.getElementById('show-controls').addEventListener('click', () => {
       document.getElementById('controls-info').classList.toggle('hidden');
   });
   ```

### Important Fixes (Improves UX)

4. **Fix Settings Back Button (Bug #4)**
   - In `ui.js:52-54`, modify the existing `close-settings` click handler to also re-show the pause screen. Replace:
   ```js
   // Current code at ui.js:52-54
   closeSettings.addEventListener('click', () => {
       document.getElementById('settings-screen').classList.add('hidden');
   });
   ```
   With:
   ```js
   closeSettings.addEventListener('click', () => {
       document.getElementById('settings-screen').classList.add('hidden');
       document.getElementById('pause-screen').classList.remove('hidden');
   });
   ```

5. **Fix Render Distance Slider (Bug #7)**
   - Change slider default from 50 to 48 (a valid step), or change step from 16 to 1

6. **Fix Skin Color Placement (Bug #6)**
   - Move the Skin Color setting from under "Audio" to a new "Appearance" or "Player" section in `index.html`

7. **Fix Crafting Recipe Names (Bug #8)**
   - Change "Stick (4)" to "Stick from Birch (4)" and "Stick from Jungle (4)" in `crafting.js:45,50`

---

## 🏆 Conclusion

The Voxel World game is an **impressive and ambitious** Minecraft clone with 200+ features implemented in pure JavaScript. The code architecture is solid, the world generation works, and the UI design is professional.

However, **2 critical bugs prevent any real gameplay**: the death loop and the inventory error. These are both straightforward fixes (spawn height calculation and DOM element null check), but they completely block testing of any other features like building, crafting, combat, etc.

### Updated Verdict (Feb 13, 2026)
With the test suite now passing (98/98 after `npm install`), the code quality concern from the previous report is resolved. The remaining blockers are the 2 critical gameplay bugs.

**Rating: 7.5/10** — Excellent foundation, blocked by fixable critical bugs.

With Bug #1 (death loop) and Bug #2 (inventory) fixed, this would jump to **9/10**.
